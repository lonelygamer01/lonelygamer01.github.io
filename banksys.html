        This little program was written is C++, and represents a kind of bank system. Unfortunately with no database, it simply uses text files stored locally in the computer. First the program makes sure the files are available and if not it creates them with 1 example user where the username and the password is "example". The app has few funcions, You can register as a new customer, then You can log-in immediately, You have 3 attempts before the app throws You back to the main page. You can open new bank accounts up to 4 and the program refuse to open new if You reach the limit. You can view Your customer profile as well. There are some functions which are unavailable due to the limitations of the text files, such as modifying a specific element of a specific line...
